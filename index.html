            <p class="sectionSubTab text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development.Education originated as
                transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
                encompass new ideas such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented information,
                skills needed for the modern society, empathy and complex vocational skills.UNESCO defines three main
                learning settings.Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually
                structured by curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTab text-small">Numerous definitions of education have been suggested by theorists
                belonging to diverse fields.Many agree that education is a purposeful activity directed at
                achieving certain aims, especially the transmission of knowledge.However, there are deep disagreements
                about the exact nature of education besides these general characteristics. According to some
                conceptions, it is primarily a process that occurs during events like schooling, teaching, and
                learning. On this view, education is what educated persons have, i.e. the mental states and
                dispositions that are characteristic of them.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Lets Grow Together</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTab text-small">In informal learning, there is often a reference person, a peer or
                expert, to guide the learner. If learners have a personal interest in what they are informally being
                taught, learners tend to expand their existing knowledge and conceive new ideas about the topic being
                learned.For example, a museum is traditionally considered an informal learning environment, as
                there is room for free choice, a diverse and potentially non-standardized range of topics, flexible
                structures, socially rich interaction, and no externally imposed assessments.
